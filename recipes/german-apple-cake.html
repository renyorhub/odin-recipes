    <h3>Description</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li> 
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li> 
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>teaspoon baking soda</li> 
        <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 cups apples - peeled, cored and diced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch cake pan.</li>
